# NuData-JS
challenge 1 and 2 of Nudata on TicketMaster 


Finished this a few months back and didnt want to create the whole api (didnt find it necessary -- Im a browser dev we already pass lol)
Challenge 1 is the get request data
Challenge 2 is the post request data 

Init.js and Sync.JS are used for both payloads to create the flow and logic 
(send get for login page then pull data out of init/sync then move to post payload of final data (actual login) )


Some Notes 
- Both challenges use same encryption
- You can manipulate most of the data
- The ipr is a mouse movement check, ive seen others use ghost cursor to replicate this data
- Just wanted to drop this for others in need of it
